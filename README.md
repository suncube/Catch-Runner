Now I study ECS from Unity and for research I came up with a simple task. This is a prototype of this task.

Game description:
You need to run away from enemies. Enemies move only when the player moves. The goal is to collect as many objects (green squares) as possible before they catch you.

PS. A Hybrid ECS was used. I did not use physics, for check collisions, I used the calculation of distance from object to target.
